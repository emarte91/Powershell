# Password reset and unlock script
This script will check AD for an entered samaccountname. If nothing is found, the script will restart. Once a correct username is entered, it will also check AD if it has manager info and display that as well. The script will have you confirm that the user info you entered is correct and it will automatically unlock the account and give you the option to reset the password.
